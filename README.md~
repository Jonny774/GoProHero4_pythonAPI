# GoProHero4_matlabAPI

Hi everyone!
Here I develloped a very simple API for go pro hero 4 by python.

I wrote this code for helping my colleagues in my lab (http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Labs/CNL/) with their study with archerfish.

My code include very simple package that called "goProHero4".

In this package I have 8 main functions:
Init: that gets the Ip if the camera (that connectd by wifi).
is_connect: that chacks if the camera are connected (after we try to init it).

still_mode: that lets us take pictures with the camera
video_mode: that lets us take videos with the camera
take_pic: that takes picture - it will works only if we changed the camera's mode to still mode!!
start_record / stop_record: that starts or stops record a video - it will works only if we changed the camera's mode to video mode!!

power_off: that turn off the camera (unfortunately, there is no way to turn on the camera - it makes sense :P)

for example you can see demo.py that:
1. init the camera.
2. check if the cammera is connected.
3. change the mode of the camera to still mode.
4. take a picture.
5. swich the camera to video mode.
6. start a new video
7. stop recording.
8. turn off the camera

(yes it is very simple to control your go pro hero 4 with python)


In the next future I plan to add an option to download all the files from the camera to the computer.

If you have any question: you are wellcome to send me an email to: ronen.no1@gmail.com

Enjoy!
